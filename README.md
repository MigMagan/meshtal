# Meshtal Package

This is a package built for dealing with MCNP mesh tallies. It supports both
fmesh and tmesh tallies (only ASCII input), and treats them as a unified 
object. You can read the files, merge them, add different tallies, create
weight windows, export to VTK, plus anything that you can implement yourself.

Although we have used the tools included quite a bit, Package is in very early 
state, so there may be incompatibilites. If you use this package and find it
useful, or have suggestion, issues, pull requests, etc, feel free to write.
