# Meshtal Module 

This is a module built for dealing with MCNP mesh tallies. It supports both
fmesh and tmesh tallies (only ASCII input), and treats them as a unified 
object. You can read the files, merge them, add different tallies, create
weight windows, export to VTK, plus anything that you can implement yourself.

We intend to put this module along with other related as a package in the
future. Work is in very early stage, so expect bugs!
If you use this module and find it
useful, or have suggestion, issues, pull requests, etc, feel free to write.
